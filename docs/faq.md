# FAQ

### Where is the source code?

Not published yet.

The port is in active development and large parts of it are still moving — the renderer fork in particular. Publishing it in this state would mean half-working forks and broken builds circulating under the project's name while the real thing is still being fixed. The source will be opened when the port is finished enough that what people build actually represents it.

In the meantime this repository exists so the work is visible: what it does, how it does it, and what is left.

### Will there be a download?

Eventually, of a *patcher* — never of the game.

Any release would require you to supply your own legally obtained copy of Lost Odyssey. No game code, no game assets, and no recompiled executable will ever be distributed here. That is not only a legal position, it's the practical one: it is what keeps projects like this online.

### What will I need to play it?

Your own copy of the game — all four discs.

The intended layout is one folder per disc next to the executable, `data\disc1` to `data\disc4`, each holding that disc's extracted files. ISO images and Games on Demand packages also work, read where they are without extracting anything. The game changes discs by itself when the story needs it.

### Does it modify my game files?

No. Game data is only ever read. The one file the port copies is the disc 1 executable, into its own cache, and only when booting from an ISO image or a Games on Demand package. The in-game settings read the game's font and menu textures from your copy each time; they are never stored anywhere.

### Why not just use Xenia?

Xenia is an excellent emulator and this project would not exist without the work behind it. They solve different problems.

An emulator translates the game's code while it runs. A static recompilation translates it *once*, ahead of time, into a normal PC executable. The result runs the game's logic as native x86-64 with no interpreter or JIT in the way — but more importantly for this project, it makes the game *modifiable* in ways an emulator cannot easily match:

- Fixes become toggles in an options menu instead of external patch files.
- The renderer is part of the build, so it can be changed — which is how a game hard-limited to 720p by console memory ends up rendering at anything from 900p to 4K with its interface intact.
- The output is a single executable that behaves like a PC game.

The cost is that the work is per-title and substantial. Xenia runs thousands of games; this runs one.

### Does it run better than the console?

Yes, in the ways you would expect from native code and a modern GPU: 60 fps, higher resolutions, anisotropic filtering, supersampling, and no loading from optical media.

### Does it have the crashes this game is known for under emulation?

No. The three well-known ones — the Grand Staff prison cell, the cutscene after the first boss, and the frozen train on disc 3 — do not happen here, at 60 fps and with no workaround. The second one did crash in this port at first; its cause was found and fixed. The [README](../README.md#the-known-crashes-are-gone) has the full list, including the port's own bugs and their status.

The game has not yet been played start to finish, so there may be problems nobody has met. If the port crashes, it writes a report naming the original game function it was in.

### Why does the first launch take a minute or two?

The graphics driver has to compile about two thousand pipelines before the first frame. The port keeps the result on disk, so this happens once per resolution and renderer. After that, startup takes a few seconds.

The cache takes roughly 230 MB per resolution on Direct3D 12 and 30 MB on Vulkan. It is safe to delete; the next launch rebuilds it.

### Which resolution should I pick?

The one your monitor has. Each preset costs what its own pixel count costs, so 1080p is noticeably lighter than 1440p, and 1800p lighter than 4K. The interface is identical at all of them.

### Linux? Steam Deck? Android?

Linux is planned and is the reason the Vulkan renderer exists — the recompilation SDK supports Linux, including arm64. It has not been built yet.

Android is not supported by the SDK, so it is not on the table.

### Can I help / can I test it?

Not yet, but this is worth asking again later. Watch the repository for updates.

### Is this affiliated with Microsoft, Mistwalker or Feelplus?

No. This is an unaffiliated, non-commercial preservation effort. Lost Odyssey is © its respective rights holders.
